              As a WordPress plugin, WPFeedback had limitations, particularly
              around payment flexibility, collaboration scope (limited to
              WordPress sites), and scalability. It required a strategic
              transformation into a SaaS product with visual collaboration
              across all web platforms, advanced infrastructure, and seamless
              user experience.

                Tech Emulsion developed a feature-rich SaaS platform tailored to
                Bipcards.com&apos;s needs, focusing on scalability, user
                experience, and operational efficiency. For Admins, we created a
                comprehensive analytics dashboard that displays overall platform
                performance, including total card taps, and line charts showing
                customer activity trends. Leaderboards were introduced to
                highlight top-performing team members and their recent activity.
                Admins can also access a sales overview page that shows total
                sales, individual sales rep targets versus actual sales, and
                comparative analyses of budget versus sales. Inventory
                management was implemented to manage seven different platform
                types—such as Google, Instagram, WhatsApp, Trustpilot,
                TripAdvisor, Reco, and Yelp—across three product types—Card,
                Stand, and Plate—allowing seamless inventory addition, updating,
                and management. Subscription and fulfillment integration with
                Stripe was established to view and manage all customer
                subscriptions and link with the fulfillment center for automated
                order processing. Admins also have full control over adding,
                updating, and deleting users across all roles.

              >
                Customers can access their own personalized analytics page,
                mirroring the admin dashboard but focused on their business.
                Insights into card performance, tap activity over time, and team
                member contributions are available. Customers can edit personal
                details, manage subscriptions, and add team members. Team
                performance stats and leaderboards encourage healthy
                competition, while a shop section allows customers to upgrade
                subscriptions and purchase additional products or services.

                Sales Representatives benefit from unique payment links and QR
                codes that automatically create customer accounts upon scanning.
                This streamlined onboarding process reduces friction, and new
                customers receive credentials via email for instant access.
                Sales reps can track performance metrics, compare their results
                against peers, and view available inventory.
